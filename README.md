## Introduction

The Printf project is a customized implementation of the printf function in the C language. The printf function is a standard library function used to display formatted messages on standard output (usually the console).

## Purpose

The aim of this project is to create a simplified version of the printf function to understand the underlying concepts related to variable arguments and format specifiers in C.


## üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Compilation
```js
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 -Wno-format *.c
```

## üßê Features   

A few of the things you must do before checking the task:

- Read the task or challenge.
- Rephrase it in your own words.
- Verify expected behavior by getting example inputs and outputs.
- Whiteboard your solution with words.
- Walk through your solution with an example as if you were a machine. Do only what is written down. Correct your solution if needed.
- Whiteboard your solution with pseudocode.
- Walk through your solution with an example as if you were a machine. Do only what is written down. Correct your solution if needed.
- Whiteboard your solution with code.
- Walk through your solution with an example as if you were a machine. Do only what is written down. Correct your solution if needed.
- Write your code on your computer. [Note: This is this first time you are using your computer! Only when you know exactly what to code.]
- Test your code on your computer.
- Debug if necessary.
- You complete the task or challenge!


## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don‚Äôt have to push them to your repo (if you do we won‚Äôt take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called main.h
- Don‚Äôt forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded
- Note that we will not provide the _putchar function for this project
